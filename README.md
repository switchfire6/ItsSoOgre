# It's So Ogre üëπ

Hi! Welcome to "It's So Ogre," a frantic little browser game where your main goal is simple: **DON'T GET CAUGHT BY THE OGRES!**

I put this together as a fun, single-file HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project. You control a speedy runner (üèÉ) and have to survive increasingly challenging levels filled with relentless ogres.

## Features

*   **Progressive Difficulty:** Each level ups the ante with more ogres and tougher conditions.
*   **Relentless Ogres:** They're not just wandering aimlessly; they're coming for *you* with increasingly erratic movement!
*   **Shield Power-ups:** Starting from Level 3, you can grab a shield (üõ°Ô∏è) for temporary invincibility. Use it wisely!
*   **Timed Levels:** Survive the clock to advance to the next challenge.
*   **Persistent High Score:** The game remembers your longest survival streak across playthroughs.
*   **Emoji-tastic Graphics:** Who needs complex sprites when you have expressive emojis?
*   **Sleek UI:** A clean interface to keep track of your level, time, and the all-important longest survival record.
*   **Pause Functionality:** Need a breather? Hit pause!

## How to Play

1.  **Movement:** Use the **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** keys to move your little runner (üèÉ).
2.  **Objective:** Avoid touching the ogres (üëπ).
3.  **Survive:** Stay alive until the timer for the current level reaches zero.
4.  **Power-ups:** Collect shields (üõ°Ô∏è) when they appear (from Level 3 onwards) for a brief period of invincibility.
5.  **Progression:** Beat a level to move to the next, or retry if you get ogre'd!

## How to Run

It's super simple:
1.  Download the `index.html` file.
2.  Open it in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3.  That's it! The game will load, and you can start playing.

## Tech Stack

This game is built with the classic web trio:
*   Plain **HTML** for the structure.
*   Plain **CSS** for styling (with some cool CSS variables for theming!).
*   Plain **JavaScript (ES6+)** for all the game logic and interactivity ‚Äì no frameworks, no libraries, just pure JS!

## Future Ideas (Maybe!)

If I ever come back to tinker with this, I might consider:
*   More power-up types.
*   Different ogre behaviors or types.
*   Sound effects (ogre groans, shield pings!).
*   Mobile touch controls.

Thanks for checking it out! Hope you have fun trying not to get eaten.
